# Computer Use

Control the computer using voice on a web app.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node test.js
```

## Libraries

- **Why not Python?**: I mostly need browser automation. JavaScript is more aligned with browsers. There are more modern automation libraries for JavaScript.
- **Wny not Deno?**: I'd like to but couldn't install puppeteer on Deno.
